  The DriverPass project was a theoretical project about a company that wanted to open up because of the amount of students failing their driver exam. DriverPass wanted to create a system where students could sign up for three different levels of driving courses. Within these courses there were different access points for the system. What I thought I did well was understanding the business requirements for the new system. Things like suers, budget, application, realistic time frame. If I could go back and redo a section of it, it would be the Gantt Chart. Because of the lack of information for the requirements of the class, like how many days the client was referring to when discussing how long it would take (business day or regular days) it was hard for me to pinpoint a real launch date. I took the usersâ€™ needs as the foundation of what they system needed to be. The user is the one interfacing with the application, If it does not work for them, then the client would not make money because the user would not buy the product. I approached design this software as if it was my first time, I made sure I was really thorough and wanted to client and user to be happy. Some strategies I will use in the future are daily Scrum meetings, the agile concept, carefully constructed positive written communication for my team.
